Scrum and Agile
At school we used JIRA to control our sprints, the task or tickets, story poitns, assignments, etc.
Each sprint was two weeks long, I had two projects one where I was just a member and the other where I was a team lead.
As a team lead my job was to brainstorm the direction of the project or the goals we wanted to accomplish that sprint.
And  also assign who would want to do which task, if 1 person could do this or if 2 were needed.
At the end of the two weeks we had a sprint demo where we would present our progress to the class and teacher.


Agile we were flexible on going back and redisigning things, and possible refractors in the code for a new feature the professor wants.
