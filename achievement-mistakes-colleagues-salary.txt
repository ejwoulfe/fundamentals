Professional Achievement
Gone out of my way to learn a whole stack by myself, got some introductions in school, but along with school I was grinding.
Learned web development, built 3 projects, watched over 100 videos on the web dev, listening to podcast, keeping up to date.

Mistakes
I could have had cleaner code, reductant codes. API fetchs instead of storing it in props.

Colleagues
Easy to work with, open for ideas and critisim.

Salary
Junior Developer salary for the area, not very experienced in the Professional field so yea.
