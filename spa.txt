SPA - Single Page Applications
Property vining???
Dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. 
Routing - have only certain part of the page refresh instead of having everything load.
Components - reuse certain parts like modals.
Only certain parts of the page will be loading data instead of the whole page.
